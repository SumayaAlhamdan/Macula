Macula aims to enhance student engagement through a web-based system developed with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). By leveraging computer vision, we created a system that uses facial recognition to automate attendance tracking and provide real-time feedback on student engagement to educators. The system also incorporates gamification elements to boost participation and transform the classroom experience.
